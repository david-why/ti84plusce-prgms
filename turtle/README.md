# turtle
Turtle-ish drawing on the calculator!

## Usage
1. Send the program to your calc.
2. Create a program with any name, but preferably a short one because you will have to type it in.
3. Write some Logo-like code inside, e.g.:
   ```
   LT 90
   FD 100
   LABEL "HELLO!
   ```
4. Quit the program editor and run `Asm(prgmTURTLE`.
5. Enter the name of the program you just created. Please type it instead of choosing it from the <kbd>prgm</kbd> menu.
6. Watch and enjoy!

## TODO
- Support `repeat`
- Allow commands be merged into one line
