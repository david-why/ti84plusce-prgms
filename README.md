# ti84plusce-prgms
Some of my ASM creations for the TI-84+ CE.

To run these programs, you need the CE C 'Standard' Libraries for your calculator.

You can find them [here](https://github.com/CE-Programming/libraries/releases/latest).

Special thanks to @mendsley for the wonderful library [tinystl](https://github.com/mendsley/tinystl)!

## Compilation
To compile these programs, you need the CE C Toolchain installed on your computer.

The toolchain is found [here](https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain/releases/latest).

After you have that installed, run `make` in one of the programs' directory.

You should see the 8xp file in the `bin` directory, just transfer that to your calc with TI Connect CE or TiLP.

## Liscense
Umm... I have NO IDEA how this works. So do whatever you want with this code. I guess.
